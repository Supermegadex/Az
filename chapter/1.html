<p><span class="mon">“Don't you have anything better to do?"</span> Frisk heard for the twentieth time.</p>
<p>Frisk thought for a moment. <span class="mon"><i>Do I?</i></span> They never really thought about it; they always just believed they needed to do this, to save the one being without hope. Frisk finally pondered over it and came to the conclusion that yes, this was what they needed to do. They had nothing better to do than what they were doing right now. Asriel, after all, was the one who had the power to release the whole of the monsters, so he deserved to live a long, happy life. Frisk reached out their hand and called Asriel's name.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“What are you doing, Frisk?"</span> asked the monster, confused.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“I truly have nothing better to do,"</span> replied Frisk. <span class="mon">“And, by the look of things, I think you need something better to do."</span></p>
<p>With that, the fluffy goat boy took Frisk's hand. Together, they walked to Toriel’s house. Asriel's head bowed as he remembered his life with his parents. They headed to the room where Frisk stayed their first night in the ruins and sat on the bed. Frisk looked at the wall, unsure of what to say.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“You know, Frisk--"</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“Yes, I know. You'll turn back into Flowey soon. You've told me that before. But, I believe that won't happen; not when you have the DETERMINATION you do and I am here to support you."</span> They turned to Asriel and looked at him straight in the eyes. <span class="mon">“You are a good person, Asriel. You may not be able to feel it in a little while, but you have to know it's true. Just hold on to yourself and hold onto me and we'll figure this out."</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“Okay."</span> He took a deep breath. <span class="mon">“I need to rest. Can we wait to head up for a few minutes?"</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“Sure. Anything for you, brother."</span></p>
<p>At the word "brother," Asriel attacked Frisk, almost strangling them with a tight hug. He cried for a few moments before they both passed out.</p>
