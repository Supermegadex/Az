<p><span class="mon">“Where am I?"</span> asked Asriel and <span class="chara"></span> simultaneously.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“You're inside of my soul,"</span> answered Frisk.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“Damn, I hurt like I just got mauled by a bear,"</span> <span class="chara"></span> said.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“Why did you absorb us, Frisk?"</span></p>
<p>Not knowing how Asriel knew their name, Frisk assumed that the body and SOUL were always connected.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“ANSWER YOUR 'LITTLE FRIEND!'"</span> <span class="chara"></span> spat.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“I need to SAVE you, Asriel. I need you to be happy. <span class="chara"></span>, this doesn't have anything to do with you. You've hurt so many people, even your own brother. I'm not going to try and save you"</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“What? Don't you know? I'm bound to Asriel's SOUL!"</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“They're right, Frisk. I absorbed their SOUL a long time ago. I'm sorry, you can't save me. I don't know if I would be able to let go if I tried."</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“That's right, Asriel. I'm always here for you. I am your sibling, after all. We love each other, right?"</span> The fallen child grinned at Frisk. Their rosy cheeks and red eyes pierced Frisk's very being, but Frisk held on.</p>
<p>Asriel noticed Frisk's DETERMINATION worn on the child’s face. He also noticed the evil grin <span class="chara"></span> held. He began to cry. He glanced at <span class="chara"></span>, then held his gaze on Frisk.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“You know, maybe I am willing to let go. <span class="chara"></span> was never REALLY my friend. They hated humanity and, now that I have a new perspective, I think they were using us! Frisk! You’ve opened my eyes!"</span> He jerked his head at <span class="chara"></span>. <span class="mon">“You were USING us, weren't you! I can't believe I trusted you!"</span></p>
<p>Shocked, <span class="chara"></span> looked around nervously. <span class="mon">“You...you really think that? I…I'm your FRIEND, Asriel! All of those years; we grew up together! Asriel, please! I don't want to die! If you let me go, I'll die!"</span></p>
<p>Asriel ignored them. <span class="mon">“Frisk, we didn't live in the timeline. Our combined SOULS lived behind the scenes. With the help of a skeleton—I think his name was Aster, or Gaster, or something—we had the DETERMINATION and raw power to live while Flowey reset time after time. We were dormant until you revived us. I can't thank you enough, Frisk."</span> He turned with a grim frown toward the first child. <span class="mon">“I think you are ready to go, <span class="chara"></span>."</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“Wh…what? You, too, Asriel? No, I'm not ready!"</span></p>
<p>With that, Asriel released the grasp he had on <span class="chara"></span>'s SOUL. <span class="hint" onclick="Materialize.toast('Fear not, you Chara-lovers! They are not REALLY gone yet!', 4000)">It was done.</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“Thanks again, Frisk. What do I owe you--Oh!"</span></p>
<p>Frisk embraced the fluffy monster. They had to say, Asriel was quite comfortable.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“Nothing,”</span> Frisk replied. <span class="mon">“Nothing but your friendship…brother.”</span> They released Asriel, who was now crying harder than Flowey.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“<span class="chara"></span> never treated me this way. They never really liked to talk, or play many games, or well, anything friendly. I'm glad you're here.”</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“I’m glad I could save you.”</span></p>
